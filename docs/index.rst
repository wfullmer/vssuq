About
-----

**Hello and welcome to the VSSUQ repo!** The VSSUQ is a Very Small-Scale 
particle fluidization experiment designed and operated by 
`Wyatt (Casey) LaMarche <https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-lamarche-448a33a3>`_ 
of the `Hrenya Research Group <http://hrenya.colorado.edu>`_
at the University of Colorado. The VSSUQ was specifically designed for 
Uncertainty Quantification studies using a 
coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method approach. 
A complete description and most reliable reference for this work can be found
in the published paper (forthcoming). It is hoped that the summary data and its 
underlying reference data might help facilitate the modeling process. 
All figures, scripts, data and ``rst`` source files for this documentation 
are housed in the `VSSUQ github repository <https://github.com/wfullmer/vssuq>`_. 
Contributions are welcome; for concerns and corrections please open an issue or 
create a pull request in the repo.
