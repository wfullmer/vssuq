Hello! The VSSUQ for CFD-DEM is a Very Small-Scale experiment and associated 
dataset specifically designed for Uncertainty Quantification studies using a 
coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method approach. 
A complete description and most reliable reference for this work can be found
in the published paper (forthcoming). It is hoped that the summary data and its 
underlying reference data might help facilitate modeling by potential future 
users. The data (and source files for this documentation itself) is stored in 
the `VSSUQ github repository. <https://github.com/wfullmer/vssuq>`_. 
Contribution is welcome; for concerns and corrections please open an issue or 
create a pull request in the repo.
